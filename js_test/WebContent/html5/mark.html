<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><mark>"HTML5" </mark>has at various times been used to refer to a wide variety of technologies, some of which originated in this document, and some of which have only ever been tangentially related.</p>
 
<p>This specification actually now defines the next generation of HTML after <mark>HTML5</mark>. <mark>HTML5</mark> reached Last Call at the WHATWG in October 2009, and shortly after we started working on some experimental new features that are not as stable as the rest of the specification. The stability of sections is annotated in the margin.</p>
